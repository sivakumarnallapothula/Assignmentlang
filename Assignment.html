                            It is located in a green and peaceful neighbourhood.
                            We have gardens in the front and back of the house.
                            When you step inside the house, you will enter a spacious living room.
                            Our house has five rooms. My sister and I each have a separate room.
                            My room has a balcony that faces the neighbouring park.
                            I spend time on my balcony every evening and enjoy watching the sunset with my grandpa.
                            We have a kitchen in the house that connects to the garden in the back.
                            We grow all types of herbs and vegetables in the kitchen garden.
                            My house is the best one in the whole world.

                        <p>Harry Potter is one of my favourite movie. This movie becoming my favourite since it has been held on theatre eight years ago. In my opinion, the story is totally awesome. Based on the best seller novel by JK.Rowling, this movie becomes real. I mean that the story is fiction, but it looks real when we see the movie. This movie story tells about Harry Potter, he is a wizard child since he was a baby, but his parents died by the hand of The Dark wizard,Voldemort. So, he had to struggled on his whole life. When he turned to a young boy, Hogwart school of wizard and wizardry sent him a message that he is a student of that school. In there, he learned everything about magic, and also he found his true friendship, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. They always helped Harry Potter in everything, whether is right or wrong. They do this all together, happiness or sorrow. Harry Potter also learned how to love his parents, friends, teachers, and everything.

                            When Voldemort comes to kill Harry Potter, Harry against hard to be win. His bestfriend helped him until they comes to chaotic, but they still hold out. With his witchcraft power, his friends help, and their corageous, voldemort got lost.
